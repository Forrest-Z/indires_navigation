# costmap_2d
The regular costmap_2d package of ROS has a dependency on PCL. Therefore, as we are using here the version 1.9.1 of the PCL library, we need to include this package with the aim of keeping everything working properly. Only the CMakeLists.txt has been modified to take the PCL version 1.9.1 in comparison with the original ROS package (Kinetic distro).

## Dependences
The same as the standard costmap_2d package or ROS.


## Parameters
The same as the standard costmap_2d package or ROS. See http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d?distro=kinetic
